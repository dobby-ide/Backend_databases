Explain the difference between INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTER) JOIN and RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN.


running a JOIN clause between two tables will determine the two table to have a final result based on the 
common identifier of the two tables which in turns, are the common column of the two tables.

INNER JOIN
the result will be forced to be only the INTERSECTION on the values of the columns of the two tables where the query exists. 

LEFT JOIN
the result will also include those values of the JOINED table even if the clause (ON) condition is not applicable.
RIGHT JOIN
the result will also include those values of the "original" (FROM) table even if the clause (ON) condition is not true.
