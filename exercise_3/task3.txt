the deletion of employees is not possible because of a CONSTRAINT. When the db has been created the foreign key has been created to preserve the integrity of the database.
In this case the constrain for the foreign key depends on the child table "purchase_orders" in column "created_by".
This constraint was specifically designed to prevent any child kill. On delete NO ACTION prevents the deletion of the row(s). 
On the other hand On delete CASCADE would have set the child tables to some null value.
