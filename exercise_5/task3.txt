#        Why root user is a special user?
#	 The first thing to notice is that root user is linked to 3 hosts: 
#        3 localhosts in different formats.
#        Root user has all privileges and can set other users and roles, 
#        grant privileges and needs to be secured by using a strong password. 
#        Apparently there is nothing so special about root user and
#        it can be replaced allowing a 
#        newly created user with grant privileges as well.
#------------------
#        Why root user need to be secured and remote login disabled?
#        Because if someone gets access to it then it can destroy 
#        the whole database, 
#        stealing data from it and manipulate the whole database, 
#        depending on the importance of the data 
#        inside the database, the root 
#        user needs to be secured with a strong password.
#        And the root needs to be connected to a localhost 
#        because of the same reason,
#        security comes first so we want to make sure root is only 
#        accessible via the same computer
#-----------------
#        Explain how to disable remote login from root user
#
#        DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root' 
#        AND Host NOT IN ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1');
